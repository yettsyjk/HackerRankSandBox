### This is my HackerRank Sand Box
My name Yettsy Jo Knapp from Denver, Colorado.
Since graduating Skill Distillery on July 7th, 2020, I have been attempting to complete as many HackerRank Challenges that may help me be a better candidate in the world of employed Java Developers. 
### Tools 
1. Spring Tool Suite 4
1. Java JDK
1.  [Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com) 
1.  [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) to time my challenges

### Lessons Learned
1. Timing myself to complete most of these in under 45 minutes, I utilized forums and browser searches whenever I became stuck and time crunched.
2.  Stay humble, take breaks, and when the forums explain their angle of their code try your best to put in your words.
3. More to come..
